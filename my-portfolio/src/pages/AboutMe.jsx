      <p>
        Hi, I'm Pedro Quintero, a passionate developer based in Tucson, Arizona. 
        I specialize in web development and have experience with technologies like 
        Node.js, React, TypeScript, Outsystems and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always eager to learn new skills and stay up to date with the latest 
        trends in technology. Outside of coding, I enjoy exercising, hiking, listening to audiobooks and going to music festivals.
      </p>
